% to add numbers 
a=2+2 ;
b = 3+2 ; 
a , b 

% to find square roots 
 c = sqrt(a)

 % to write matrix 
 
 A = [1 2 ; 5 6] ;
 A 
 
 %to write transpose of matrix

 A'
 
 % we can also multipy matrices like this :
 B = [3 0 ; 1 2] ;
 A*B

 % use of colon operator 
 x = 1:5 
 y = 1:2:10
